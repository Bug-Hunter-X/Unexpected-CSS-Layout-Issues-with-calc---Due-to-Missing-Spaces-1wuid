The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a subtle bug that can occur when using `calc()` with percentages and other units together, particularly if there's a missing space between the operators and values. For example, `width:calc(50% - 10px);` will cause unexpected behavior because there's no space after the `50%`. The correct form is `width: calc(50% - 10px);`.
