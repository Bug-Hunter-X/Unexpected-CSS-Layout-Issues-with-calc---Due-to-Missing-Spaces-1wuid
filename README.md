This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in CSS when using the `calc()` function.  The problem stems from a lack of spacing between the operators and values within the calculation.  The `bug.css` file showcases the incorrect implementation that leads to unexpected behavior, while the `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected version with proper spacing. This issue can manifest as unexpected widths, heights, or margins, making it important to carefully write `calc()` expressions.
