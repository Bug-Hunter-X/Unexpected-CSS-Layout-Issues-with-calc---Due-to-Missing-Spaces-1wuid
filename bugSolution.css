The solution is simple: always add a space after the operators in your `calc()` expressions.  Here's the corrected code that will produce the expected result:

```css
width: calc(50% - 10px);
/*Correct usage*/
```
By adhering to this rule, you avoid common pitfalls and ensure `calc()` functions as intended.
